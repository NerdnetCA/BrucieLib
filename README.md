# BrucieLib

## How to build and execute

I guess the quickest method:
```
gradlew desktop:run
```

## How to hack

See desktop/src/com/rixonsoft/brucielib/desktop/DesktopLauncher for the entry point.

In the brucielib package, examine the following files:

  * BrucieGame
  * BrucieConfig
  * test/GameSelector
  * test/TestScene
  * test/TestBundle
  * AssetBag
